Screen is black
Son today:

You pushed me off that road…. didn’t you?”
You still want a moment alone with me, by your fire?
It’s not like we didn’t spend enough time here already.
Well, fate made the path diverge, and now the kid of the Cabin found his own way,
Guess what…. you pulled him back…

Game starts and the player gets to walk around the first area

*Coughs*

Son today:

Seems like this place dragged back into the dirt…
I used to get my feet wet, tramping through the old bog…
now that don’t seem all that bad to be honest…

Crossroads

Son:

Back on the old property…this place has phased too little.

Beanie

Woman voice:

Don’t you dare pull that off your head!
Its freezing out 
and I don’t want you getting sick!

Collar:

Son young:
Here boy! The pond is this way!
Did you go straight for those blueberries!
Well, I think you and the kid both need a bath in the lake!

Howl:

Fathers voice:

You old dirt bag!
Don’t you try to run across that fence you ugly dog!

*dog whimpers*

Son young:

Dad! He didn’t know!

Fathers voice:

You better shut it boy!
If your sorry ass aint gonna keep control over him,
then I guess you aint thought right!
 
 
 
 
Laid down to take it, you just laid down and watched her, and you did nothing!

Burnt Campfire:

Fathers voice:

It disgusts me how weak you`ve always been,
Where do you think that attitude will take you?
It pains, knowing you are too weak to even light a match
Shed1:
Fathers voice:

Its time you learn how to use an axe

Son young:

Dad, we were just gonna grab some twigs…
We wanted to use them to make a fire…

Fathers voice:

you don’t even know how…
Little shit, its better you learn it now
how to break something apart…

Hillside:

Father:

how can you still be so weak?
so crippled to not stand and swing an axe
now, If I don’t see that axe swung against a stump
I`ll make sure it goes the other direction!

Beach1:

Woman’s voice:

It’s so hot out here today!
Hope they both are catching up with us!

Son young:

Mom? Mom!?
I didn’t mean to! I wanted to…
Mom, I wanted to…
…help
 
Boat:

Father: 

You knew it!
you knew what happened…
and you did nothing!
you just sat there!
You just wept, like some sorry kid!
She was all alone…
And we could not make it…
I wonder what would happen…
If you didn’t make it…

Shed2:

How dare you try to hide! 
You know what happens!
If you keep at it, you`ll stay there forever.

By window:

You tried to fucking run.
